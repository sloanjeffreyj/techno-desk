# Setup
The only thing you'll need to do with the code is add your own API key for openweathermap.org.
To do this, change 'const String key = ""' by adding your API key inbetween the quotes.

I will probably (emphasis on probably) add a wiring diagram for the whole thing at some point,
but if you're familiar with these kinds of projects the variable names should make it obvious enough.
